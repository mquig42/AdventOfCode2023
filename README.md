# AdventOfCode2023

Solutions to Advent of Code 2023. This year I'm using .NET 8 so I can get some more experience with things like WebAssembly and Azure. The app is deployed to https://mq2023.azurewebsites.net/

The source files for each individual day are in AdventOfCode2023.Client/Components/Pages
